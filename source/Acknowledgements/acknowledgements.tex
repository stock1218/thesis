Thank you to Maverick Woo who initially proposed the idea for this thesis and has guided me throughout this journey. I would also like to thank Patrick Tague for helping me through major milestones throughout this project and providing useful feedback when requested. Thank you to the Scholarship for Service program for funding my time at Carnegie Mellon and this thesis. Finally, I am forever grateful for the invaluable support my family and friends have provided me, without which none of this would be possible.
