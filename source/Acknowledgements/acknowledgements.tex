Thank you to Maverick Woo who initially proposed the idea for this thesis and has guided me throughout this journey. I would also like to thank Patrick Tague for helping me through major milestones throughout this project and providing useful feedback when requested. I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable support my family and friends have provided me, without which none of this would be possible.
